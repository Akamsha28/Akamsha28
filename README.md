# Hi there, I'm Akamsha Reddy! ðŸ‘‹

[cite_start]I'm an **AI Data Engineer** based in Dallas, TX [cite: 2][cite_start], with 5+ years of experience building cloud-native ETL pipelines and real-time data platforms across banking, healthcare, and quantum research domains[cite: 6]. [cite_start]I specialize in integrating ML models, optimizing data infrastructure, and delivering impactful analytics solutions[cite: 7].

### ðŸš€ What I'm currently working on:
[cite_start]At Freddie Mac, I'm designing and building real-time loan ingestion pipelines using Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Dataflow to process borrower applications submitted via APIs[cite: 30]. [cite_start]I'm also optimizing BigQuery and Synapse workloads [cite: 32][cite_start], and gaining proficiency in Snowflake optimization and cost management strategies[cite: 32].

### ðŸ’¡ My Expertise Includes:

* [cite_start]**Languages:** Python, Java, SQL, JavaScript [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**Big Data & Tools:** PySpark, Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, Databricks, Delta Lake [cite: 10]
* [cite_start]**Cloud Platforms:** Microsoft Azure (ADF, Synapse, Event Grid), Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Dataflow, Vertex AI, Pub/Sub) [cite: 11]
* [cite_start]**Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Azure SQL, Google BigQuery [cite: 12]
* [cite_start]**DevOps & Automation:** Terraform, Jenkins, CI/CD Pipelines, Docker, Apache Airflow [cite: 13]
* [cite_start]**AI/ML Integration:** Supporting AI/ML teams by preparing real-time feature datasets used for fraud detection and credit risk scoring models hosted on Vertex AI[cite: 34].

### ðŸŒ± I'm currently expanding my knowledge in:
-   [cite_start]Snowflake optimization and cost management strategies[cite: 32].
-   Further enhancing my skills in real-time data processing and advanced analytics.

### âœ¨ Highlights from my projects:

* [cite_start]**AI-Powered Smart Health Monitoring System:** Developed IoT-based health tracking with ECG, heart rate, and SpO2 sensors using Raspberry Pi[cite: 109]. [cite_start]Processed data in PySpark and SQL, visualized results in Power BI[cite: 110]. [cite_start]Used Azure IoT Hub for secure cloud transmission and real-time alerts[cite: 111].
* [cite_start]**Banking Customer Analytics & Risk Assessment:** Built ML models to detect fraud and segment customers using SQL, Scikit-Learn, and Tableau[cite: 114]. [cite_start]Automated risk reports, reducing audit time by 40%[cite: 115].
* [cite_start]**Sales Performance Optimization Dashboard:** Analyzed historical sales data using Python, SQL, and Power BI[cite: 118]. [cite_start]Enhanced forecasting models, reducing reporting delays by 50%[cite: 119].
